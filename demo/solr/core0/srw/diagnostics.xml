            another version is defined, for example version 1.2, this diagnostic may be returned when the server

        <details>The request includes a position in response that is not valid for the list. For example a request
            indicates a response position = 15 and maximum terms = 20, meaning that it wants a response to include 15
            entries before the term, plus the term, then another 4. The server would return this diagnostic if there
            were not 15 previous entries.

            &apos;300&apos; for details. If &apos;details&apos; is not supplied, this might mean that the server doesn&apos;t
            have a fixed maximum and was just unable to deliver all the requested terms.
